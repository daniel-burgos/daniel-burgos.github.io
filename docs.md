### Need for the Project

As an educator, and as someone who is skilled at using technology for personal and professional use, I have noticed that the majority of the population does not possess the necessary skills in order to navigate the internet safely, as well as utilize technology in ways that best adapters technology to their needs, not the other way around. This observation also includes educators, especially those that are older in age and whose fields do not rely heavily on technology use. I joined the teacher workforce at the start of the pandemic, and had many questions, as all new teachers do, however, veteran teachers were unsure how to address my areas of concern, as education had never had to suddenly transition to an online mode of teaching and learning. One of the primary struggles that educators faced was the lack of systems of support, as well as resources that would aid in the transition to a different medium of teaching delivery. The primary issue wasn’t the lack of content knowledge, but rather, the lack of experience, on how to adapt lessons to an unfamiliar medium of teaching. The only guidance that was received came from district attempting to provide educators with professional development training that had to be rushed due to the urgency to get teaching right away.
 	The Pew Research has a digital knowledge quiz that people can take for free and shows a statistical representation of how much people know (got right) with regard to privacy, cyber security, and technology. The main headline, and the results were a source of inspiration for my project. “A majority of U.S. adults can answer fewer than half the questions correctly on a digital knowledge quiz, and many struggle with certain cybersecurity and privacy questions” (Vogels & Anderson, 2019). Most people can execute basic functions that meet their daily needs, however, when a situation arises that requires them to utilize their current digital skills, and apply it to a new problem, there seems to be a disconnect in the necessary steps to take in order to achieve that goal.

#### Rationale For The Need For Instruction

Although it is believed that those born in an age of technology (digital native) where technology is accessible from a young age are computer, and digitally literate, that is not the case. Mere exposure does aid with technology utilization, however, it does not equate to how adequate or technology competent young individuals become by the time they reach the university or professional level. The solution to this issue already exists, all it requires is gathering materials and presenting educators with a simple way to access them. One example of this are massive open online courses that can be attended, or completed at a steady pace, and provide users with the tools necessary for becoming technology/digitally competent. Frameworks, and guidelines also exist, with clear standards, and the level of proficiency within each standard, that help educators determine where their ability levels lie, and what they should be able to accomplish in order to become more proficient at each standard. 

#### Instructional Goal

Teachers will be able to use MOOCs and other online resources to help address digital competency knowledge gaps when utilizing technology in a professional or personal setting.
