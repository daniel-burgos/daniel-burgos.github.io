### Need for the Project

As an educator, and as someone who is skilled at using technology for personal and professional use, I have noticed that the majority of the population does not possess the necessary skills in order to navigate the internet safely, as well as utilize technology in ways that best adapters technology to their needs, not the other way around. This observation also includes educators, especially those that are older in age and whose fields do not rely heavily on technology use. I joined the teacher workforce at the start of the pandemic, and had many questions, as all new teachers do, however, veteran teachers were unsure how to address my areas of concern, as education had never had to suddenly transition to an online mode of teaching and learning. One of the primary struggles that educators faced was the lack of systems of support, as well as resources that would aid in the transition to a different medium of teaching delivery. The primary issue wasn’t the lack of content knowledge, but rather, the lack of experience, on how to adapt lessons to an unfamiliar medium of teaching. The only guidance that was received came from district attempting to provide educators with professional development training that had to be rushed due to the urgency to get teaching right away.
 	
The Pew Research has a digital knowledge quiz that people can take for free and shows a statistical representation of how much people know (got right) with regard to privacy, cyber security, and technology. The main headline, and the results were a source of inspiration for my project. 

> A majority of U.S. adults can answer fewer than half the questions correctly on a digital knowledge quiz, and many struggle with certain cybersecurity > and privacy questions (Vogels & Anderson, 2019). 

Most people can execute basic functions that meet their daily needs, however, when a situation arises that requires them to utilize their current digital skills, and apply it to a new problem, there seems to be a disconnect in the necessary steps to take in order to achieve that goal.

#### Rationale For The Need For Instruction

Although it is believed that those born in an age of technology (digital native) where technology is accessible from a young age are computer, and digitally literate, that is not the case. Mere exposure does aid with technology utilization, however, it does not equate to how adequate or technology competent young individuals become by the time they reach the university or professional level. The solution to this issue already exists, all it requires is gathering materials and presenting educators with a simple way to access them. One example of this are massive open online courses that can be attended, or completed at a steady pace, and provide users with the tools necessary for becoming technology/digitally competent. Frameworks, and guidelines also exist, with clear standards, and the level of proficiency within each standard, that help educators determine where their ability levels lie, and what they should be able to accomplish in order to become more proficient at each standard. 

#### Instructional Goal

Teachers will be able to use MOOCs and other online resources to help address digital competency knowledge gaps when utilizing technology in a professional or personal setting.

### Learning Context

The medium of learning will be online. All of the instruction the learners receive will be online, however, the skills and knowledge that they build as a result of their online training will be performed, and utilized in the classroom. Most schools are back to the traditional, in person teaching model, however, the abrupt shift to online education that left the world shell-shocked has left its mark on education. One of the traces left behind by the COVID pandemic are the devices that remain in the possession of schools districts. The skills the learners will receive via the online learning medium will be directly applicate to their daily lives as well as the professional setting. The five domains of the digital skills test are: Information and data literacy, Communication and collaboration, Digital content creation, safety, and problem solving. All of these domains apply to at least the professional or personal setting of the learner, most with an overlap on both types of settings. Because the courses require the learner to self enroll, and are self paced, educators have the liberty of completing them at their own leisure in terms of time and place.


### Learner Analysis

The target audience for my instruction are educators who consider themselves to be beginners when it comes to utilizing technology for professional or personal use. According to the **National Center for Educational Statistics**, over 65% of educators are over the age of 30. While it is believed that those that are born in an age where access to technology is the norm, this access to technology does not directly equate to technology competency, especially for academic or professional use, as that requires a higher degree of competency to achieve. My instruction targets this population in order to provide the learners with more autonomy and confidence in order to maximize their use of technology. Honing in on the specifics of the learner, a world wide study conducted by the **IEA** (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement) called the **International Computer and Information Literacy Study** (ICILS) where over 26,000 teachers from 14 countries participated in the study. The study reported that the following are the tasks teachers are least comfortable performing:

 - Using learning management systems (59%), contributing to online discussions (58%), collaborating with others online (57%), and most comfortable Finding teaching resources on the internet (95%), producing presentation (84%). 

The study also revealed that the most frequent use of information communication technology (ICT) was: 

- The presentation of information through direct class instruction 64%, the communication with parents or guarding's about students' learning45%, the support of student led whole class discussions and presentations 43%. 

The least frequent uses were:

- The provision of feedback to students on their work 32%, the support of collaboration among students 31%, the mediation of communication between students and experts or external mentors 26%.

> Teachers who are confident in their own CIL abilities who have a positive perception of ICT use in teaching and learning and teachers who feel they work  > in a collaborative professional environment are more likely to emphasize CIL and CT in their teaching (ICILS, 2018).

Some of the entry behaviors the learners could have are a slight reluctance to invest large amounts of time in to the courses, as technology skills might not appear to be something of the highest degree of importance to their personal or professional lives. Skills involving the pedagogy of teaching, or alternate activities that will produce immediate results may seem like more enticing options to spend their time on. Educators interact with technology on a consistent basis, whether that's for personal or professional use and this gives them a basis, or prior knowledge on the topic. Although most educators interact with technology every single day, most don't do so in a complex way such as to achieve the highest level of Bloom’s Taxonomy. The 2019 pandemic changed the perceptions educators had on technology integration; one of those was the immediate need to use it, rather than the option to integrate it. Technology became essential to conduct tasks that once seemed rudimentary in an in person classroom model. The delivery system causes some uneasiness on the learners. 

Most learners (the educators) of this age group are not familiar with online learning, and are more accustomed to the traditional in person model for teaching and learning; there is reluctance and doubt on how successful instruction can be that's delivered on a medium they are not comfortable operating in. Many schools still possess those student devices that were used during the time schools were online. Technology integration in the classroom has gone up, and this is one of the motives to incentivize utilizing this technology to its maximum potential The Pew Research has a digital knowledge quiz that people can take for free and shows a representation of how much people know with regard to privacy and cyber security; 

> A majority of U.S. adults can answer fewer than half the questions correctly on a digital knowledge quiz, and many struggle with certain cybersecurity > and privacy questions (Vogels & Anderson, 2019). 

I believe that these results are also reflective of the subset teachers belong to.

2. **ICT** = Information and Communication Technology
3. **CT**  = Computational Thinking
