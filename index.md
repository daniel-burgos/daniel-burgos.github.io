Hello, my name is Daniel Burgos, I am a second year 7th grade math teacher. The start of my career was during the same time the pandemic hit the United States. The first 4-5 months of my teaching career were solely online, then there was a transition to a hybrid model where about one-third through one-half of my students came to class in person. This was the first time I met some of my students, and some that remained online, I never met. 

Being a brand new teacher in this uncertain environment was an experience for me like no other. This was also the same time that I started my graduate studies. During the first couple of months I had many questions about being teacher, and most of them were with regard to student engagement, and ways to convey certain topics (pedagogy), but veteran teachers had to remind me that these were uncharted territories for them as well. As I proceeded in my graduate studies I began to learn more about educational technology, and I quickly realized there was a need for teacher training with regard to technology utilization. This was where my personal interest for computers, phones, and technology in general could be utilized in my professional life as opposed to a hobby in my personal life. 

My graduate courses were also the inspiration for me to convert the traditional form of teaching and integrate the flipped classroom approach. Now that I am nearing the end of my graduate studies, I feel as though the wealth of knowledge I have amassed can also impact the lives of educators, as I initially thought I could only influence the lives of my students.
