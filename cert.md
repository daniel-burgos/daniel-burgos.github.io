### Reflection

Prior to enrolling in the LDT Master’s I already possessed a passion for technology. To be specific the hardware side of technology (i.e. smartphones, computers, desktops, etc). I consume the majority of my content from Youtube, and these creators are primarily composed of tech “Youtubers.” I’ve always wondered if I could be capable enough to create my own Youtube channel and post videos on technology that I love. This curiosity was soon fulfilled by the class CUIN 7358: Digital Storytelling which armed me with the tools to begin exploring, and expanding my video editing skills. This is where I learned how to use iMovie to a competent degree, and since then I have graduated to a more advanced video editing software, DaVinci Resolve. At the same time I enrolled in my graduate studies, I became a teacher, and this was right in middle of the emergency lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The need for online instruction was felt throughout the world, and this is what gave me my first experience with learning management systems. I began using learning management systems prior to receiving any formal education on them. Nearing the end of my journey of my graduate studies, for now, classes like CUIN 7390, 7389, 7347 among others, have armed me with the tools to be able to create educational multimedia for my students, as well as be a more competent version of myself when it comes to utilizing learning management systems for the sake of teaching and learning. My multimedia skills have taken the form of instructional videos I create for my students in a version of the “flipped classroom” approach, and my online teaching skills have taken the form of continuous utilization of my school’s LMS on a continuous basis even though students have been in the brick and mortar setting for the past year. My future plans are to continue to develop my online teaching skills, and potentially transition to an online only form of teaching in the coming years.
